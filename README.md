# Harp, Gulp And BrowserSync

(derived from superhighfives/harp-gulp-browsersync-boilerplate)

A ready-to-go Gulp and Harp set up that does auto css injection via BrowserSync.

You can set it up via Harp with:

```console
harp init src --boilerplate mathismoder/harp_gulp_browsersync_skeleton
```

Modify files in /src.

Gulp commands:
- serve (serve from /src)
- build (builds into /dist)
